            India is one of the oldest civilizations in the world with a kaleidoscopic variety 
            and rich cultural heritage. It has achieved all-round socio-economic progress 
            since its Independence. India has become self-sufficient in agricultural 
            production and is now one of the top industrialized countries in the world 
            and one of the few nations to have gone into outer space to conquer nature 
            for the benefit of the people. It covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km, 
            extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain 
            forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, India stands 
            apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, 
            which give the country a distinct geographical entity. 
            Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards 
            and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian 
            Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.
            Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between 
            latitudes 8째 4' and 37째 6' north, longitudes 68째 7' and 97째 25' east 
            and measures about 3,214 km from north to south between the extreme latitudes 
            and about 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme longitudes. 
            It has a land frontier of about 15,200 km. The total length of the
             coastline of the mainland, Lakshadweep Islands and Andaman & Nicobar 
             Islands is 7,516.6 km.

                The Ministry of Culture plays a vital role in the preservation and 
                promotion of art and culture. 
                Its aim is to develop ways and means by which basic 
                cultural and aesthetic values and perceptions remain
                active and dynamic among the people. It also undertakes
                programmes for the promotion of various manifestations of contemporary art. 
                The Department is a nodal agency for commemorating significant events and 
                celebrating centenaries of great artists.
